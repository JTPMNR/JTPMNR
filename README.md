- 👋 Hi, I’m @JTPMNR
I'm an artist, but I'm learning IT and programming in python. This will likely be where I post my code, ask for help, and look back on how far I've come in coding.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning IT computer systems and learning Python.
     I am also interested in indie game dev, but that has been put to the side in order to pursue my studies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... (see previous lines)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I don't know. I am currently learning.
- 📫 How to reach me ... through github, mainly.
